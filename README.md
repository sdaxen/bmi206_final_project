#Reproducing Nup84 Modeling with IMP

##Introduction
The goal of this project was to attempt to reproduce the results of (REF) in modeling the Nup84 heptameric complex with the Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP). This project was completed as the final project for the BMI206 Biostatistics course tasught by Dr. Katie Pollard at UCSF in Fall of 2014. The analysis was performed primarily by Seth Axen in partnership with Hubert Nethercott.

The following is a brief summary of this project, the methods, and results.
